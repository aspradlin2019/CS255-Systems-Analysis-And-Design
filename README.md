# DriverPass Project Portfolio

This repository is a portfolio and reflection of my learning, work, and experiences during my CS255 Systems Analysis and Design course. It includes the business requirements document from Project One and the system design document from Project Two, showcasing my abilities in system analysis, design, and the creation of comprehensive technical documentation.

## Overview

### Brief Summary of the DriverPass Project
The DriverPass project involved creating a comprehensive system for a client named DriverPass, represented by its owner Liam. The system aimed to provide students with tools to prepare for their driving tests, including features like online practice exams, scheduling driving lessons, and tracking progress. The primary objective was to improve the overall success rate for driving tests by enhancing both theoretical and practical preparations.

### What Went Well
During this project, I believe I particularly excelled in the detailed collection and organization of the system requirements. I made sure to capture all functional and nonfunctional requirements while always focusing on the client’s primary goals. My UML diagrams were carefully constructed to represent the needs of DriverPass clearly and precisely, making them accessible for both technical and non-technical stakeholders.

### What I Would Revise
If I could improve one detail of my work, it would be my ability to submit on time, allowing myself more opportunities for feedback and iteration. By prioritizing timely submissions, I would give myself extra room to further enhance the quality of my work through careful review and peer input. Additionally, I would focus on enhancing the visual quality of my UML diagrams to make them even more accessible and informative for stakeholders, ensuring clarity and alignment with the project requirements.

### Interpreting and Implementing User Needs
To effectively interpret DriverPass's needs, I relied heavily on the interview transcript, understanding their vision for improving the success rate of student drivers. I broke down the requirements into actionable design components, ensuring that both the functional requirements—such as scheduling lessons—and the nonfunctional requirements—like security—were properly addressed. Considering the user's needs was crucial, as it ensured that the system would actually help students prepare in a more efficient and supportive way.

### Approach to Designing Software
When approaching software design, I focus on gathering detailed requirements and considering both object-oriented and process-oriented methodologies. In the future, I would use more iterative approaches like Agile to accommodate frequent feedback and testing cycles. Techniques such as developing use case scenarios and leveraging UML diagrams would remain central strategies to ensure comprehensive design and communication with stakeholders.
